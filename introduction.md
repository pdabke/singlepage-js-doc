# Introduction
Singlepage.js is a pure Javascript portal platform for building modular Web applications. The platform is composed of three components: 
- CLI for bootstrapping, developing, and deploying applications
- UI composition framework for constructing Web applications from Vue.js components
- Web services framework for developing backend services

## Singlepage CLI

- Component customization via auto-generated property editor
- Support for custom component commands and property editor
- Look & feel customization via CSS files and component window style overrides
- Built-in page grid layouts with the ability to define your own
- Internationalization via global message file as well as embedded component-specific messages

## Web Services Framework
